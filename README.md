# Company Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a minimal, professional company portfolio website designed for a
freelancing / software services business.  
The focus is on **trust, clarity, and conversion**, not heavy design.

The site is intentionally kept small so it’s easy to maintain and scale later.

---

## Pages
The website contains **only 4 pages**:

1. Home  
2. About  
3. Portfolio  
4. Contact Us  

This structure is optimal for freelancing, bidding platforms, and direct client outreach.
